# myscrollr.com

The marketing site, legal hub, and billing surface for
[Scrollr](https://myscrollr.com) — the desktop app that pins a live
ticker on top of whatever you're working on.

> This package is the **website**, not the product. The actual ticker
> lives in [`desktop/`](../desktop/). See the
> [root README](../README.md) for the full architecture.

## What this site does

- Landing page, pricing page, channel catalog, download page, legal
  hub.
- Auth handoff via Logto (`/callback`).
- Stripe checkout for subscriptions and lifetime purchases, including
  trial setup, proration previews, and plan switching.
- Account dashboard (`/account`) — subscription management, GDPR
  export + 30-day soft-delete.
- Public pricing data comes from the core API at
  `GET https://api.myscrollr.com/tier-limits` so desktop, website, and
  backend never disagree about caps.

## Tech

React 19, Vite 7, TanStack Router (file-based), Tailwind v4,
`@logto/react`, `@stripe/react-stripe-js`, Motion. Node 22 in CI.

## Local development

```sh
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in VITE_API_URL, Logto, Stripe publishable
npm run dev            # http://localhost:3000
```

You will also need the core API running (see [`../api/`](../api/)),
which itself needs Postgres, Redis, Logto, and Stripe. For
website-only work against production APIs, set
`VITE_API_URL=https://api.myscrollr.com` in `.env` — all the
tier-limit, billing, and legal endpoints are live and safe to read.

## Scripts

| Script           | What it does                                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `npm run dev`    | Vite dev server on port 3000.                                      |
| `npm run build`  | `vite build && tsc` — ships to `dist/`.                            |
| `npm run serve`  | Preview the production build locally.                              |
| `npm run check`  | `prettier --write . && eslint --fix` — run this before committing. |
| `npm run lint`   | ESLint only.                                                       |
| `npm run format` | Prettier only.                                                     |

## Deployment

Built as a Docker image via `Dockerfile`, pushed to DigitalOcean
Container Registry by `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, served by nginx
behind the `scrollr.myscrollr.com` ingress. Environment variables are
injected from the `scrollr-secrets` k8s secret. CSP, HSTS, and
Permissions-Policy are configured in the image's nginx.conf.

## Conventions

- **No semicolons, single quotes, trailing commas.** Prettier + ESLint
  are the source of truth; run `npm run check` before a PR.
- **Named exports only** (except route modules, which must default-
  export via `createFileRoute`).
- **Path alias `@/`** maps to `src/`.
- **Tailwind v4 zero-config** via `@tailwindcss/vite`. No
  `tailwind.config.*`.
- **Dark mode** toggles via `.dark` class on `<html>` (see
  `useTheme`).
- **Fonts** are self-hosted in `public/fonts/` via `@font-face` so we
  can ship a tight CSP.
- **Analytics:** none. Zero tracking pixels, zero telemetry — this is
  a public product promise. Don't add any without a conversation
  first.
